                    <h3>Taking care of yourself</h3> 
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>I belive that taking time to care for yourself is important as it helps 
                            me to keep a healthy view of the world and to not harm myself by doing too  
                            much at one time 
                        </p></li>
                        <li><p>This value came from me overworking myself lots of times causing  
                            lots of stress to build up and overall causing me to act in ways that  
                            I would regret later, after looking back on the actions I did I started to  
                            make more time for myself to make sure that I don't stress myself out too much 
                            and so that I can keep on working at my best without worrying about my own mental health 
                        </p></li> 
                    </ul>
                </div> 
                <hr>
                <div> 
                    <h3>Proactivity</h3>
                    <ul> 
                    <li><p>trying to be ontop of my assignments and work that I need to do
                        is important to me, I belive that being proactive helps with all
                        my other goals
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>
                        this mainly came from the same place as the first one but also
                        tring to do my best to just be ontop of things to be less stresed and have more time for myself
                    </p></li> 
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <hr> 
                <div> 
                    <h3>Being on time</h3> 
                    <ul>
                    <li><p>I belive that this is important as it helps bring order and gives goals
                        that help me do my tasks in a efficent manor
                    </p> </li>
                    <li><p>
                        this mainly came from me wanting to be more proactive in my work
                        and if I can do my work on time or earlier it can help me gather
                        more feedback on the work that I have done
                    </p></li>
